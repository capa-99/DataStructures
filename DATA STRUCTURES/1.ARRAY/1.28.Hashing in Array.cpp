//Hashing is a technique used in data structures that efficiently stores and retrieves data in a way that allows for quick access.
//Hashing involves mapping data to a specific index in a hash table (an array of items) using a hash function that enables fast retrieval of information based on its key.
//All three operations (search, insert and delete) can be achieved in O(1) time on average.
//Hashing is mainly used to implement a set of distinct items and dictionaries (key value pairs).

//Two common ways of traversing a matrix are row-major-order and column-major-order
//Row Major Order: When matrix is accessed row by row. 
//Column Major Order: When matrix is accessed column by column.
//According to time complexity, both lead to O(nÂ²), but when it comes to cache level one of the orders access will be faster compared to another. In C++, matrix is stored in row major form so while accessing the i+1th element after ith, it will most probably lead to a hit, which will further reduce the time of the program.
